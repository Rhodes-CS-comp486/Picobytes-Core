# Coding Questions Integration

This document describes the integration between the Picobytes-Core system and the execute-test service for coding questions.

## Overview

The integration allows Picobytes-Core to:
1. Present coding questions to users
2. Accept user code submissions
3. Validate submissions against test cases
4. Provide feedback on code correctness

## Components

- **CodingQuestionService**: Manages coding questions and validates submissions
- **CodeExecutionService**: Handles communication with the execute-test API
- **Database Schema**: Stores coding questions, starter code, and test cases

## Recent Improvements

### Enhanced Validation Logic

We've improved the validation logic to detect incomplete implementations that might otherwise pass tests superficially. The enhanced validation now:

1. Detects when a submission is identical to the starter code
2. Identifies submissions with only variable declarations but no actual implementation
3. Verifies that code contains meaningful calculations or operations relevant to the problem

This prevents situations where users can submit minimal non-functional code that technically compiles but doesn't actually solve the problem.

## Testing

To verify that the validation logic works correctly:

1. Run the factorial validation test:
   ```
   python Picobytes-Core/run_factorial_test.py
   ```

2. This test validates various implementations against the factorial problem, including:
   - Empty implementations
   - Implementations with only variable declarations
   - Implementations with only return statements
   - Correct recursive implementations
   - Correct iterative implementations

## Important Notes

- The execute-test repository/codebase should not be modified, only used for reference
- All integration code should be added to the Picobytes-Core codebase
- When adding new coding questions, ensure comprehensive test cases are provided to properly validate submissions
