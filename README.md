# Picobytes Core: Cutting C into Small Bytes for Rhodes Students

**PicoBytes** is a web application built to help Rhodes College students master the core concepts of C programming as taught in **COMP 251**. Through an engaging and interactive platform, students can reinforce their understanding of the course material in a fun, low-stress environment.

## üìù Project Description

PicoBytes is designed to address the common challenges students face when learning C programming, particularly in the fundamental COMP 251 course at Rhodes College. Many students struggle with the transition to C from higher-level languages or find it difficult to grasp key concepts through traditional learning methods alone.

Our application provides a supplementary learning platform with varied question types, immediate feedback, and performance tracking to help students practice C programming concepts in an interactive way. The platform allows professors to monitor student progress, identify areas where students are struggling, and customize content to better support their teaching objectives.

By offering a user-friendly interface and gamification elements like streaks and leaderboards, PicoBytes motivates students to engage with the material consistently, leading to better retention and understanding of important C programming concepts.

## üîÑ System Architecture

Picobytes follows a three-tier architecture with additional specialized services:

```
+----------------------------------+
|         Frontend (React)         |
|   User Interface & Interactions  |
+----------------+----------------+
                 |
                 v
+----------------+----------------+
|        Backend API (Flask)      |
|    Request Handling & Routing   |
+-------+------------+-----------+
        |            |
        v            v
+-------+----+  +----+---------+
| PostgreSQL |  | Execute-Test |
|  Database  |  |   Service    |
+------------+  +--------------+
```

### System Interactions:

1. **Frontend Layer**: React application that provides the user interface for students and instructors
2. **Backend API**: Flask server handling authentication, question management, analytics, and coordinating between components
3. **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL database storing user data, questions, answers, and analytics
4. **Execute-Test Service**: Containerized service that safely executes and validates student code submissions

### Key Interactions:
- Frontend makes API calls to the backend for data retrieval and submission
- Backend connects to PostgreSQL for data persistence
- When code execution is required, the backend communicates with the Docker-contained Execute-Test service via HTTP
- Email notifications are handled through backend scheduled tasks
