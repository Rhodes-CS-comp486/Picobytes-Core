## Planning Document Feedback (Group): 

- The first paragraph of your system description is a good start, but you are delving into too many details about the individual services. Think of what you could submit as an abstract for the Rhodes Symposium. What does the system do and why would anyone care about it?
- In your system description you say 'there are 4 main services', but you only listed 3. 
- You also didn't clean up your copy-paste of the earlier PicoBytes product description very well. :/
- The system diagram is a good adaptation of the earlier system diagram that came with the PicoBytes project description. The '251 stduents that are questioning their life choices' bit will be great as a visual during the Rhodes Symposium.
- Your epics are REALLY unclear. Epics are just big user stories. What you gave me is a big list of semi- connected, smaller user stories. 
- 'Web interface' shouldn't be an epic. It's just an implementation detail.
- Your non-functional requirements are great.
- Your technologies list looks like a reasonable place to start.
- Your MVP is good.
- Your roadmap is great!
- Your planning document really needs to be cleaned it. It looks like you had a lot of fun creating it, but it was difficult to read.

## Requirements Feedback (Group): 

 - Good quality on most of your user stories!
- Consistent formatting on (almost) all of your titles!
- You have acceptance criteria on (almost) all of your stories, and their pretty good!
- You have estimations on all stories and they even seem prioritized!
- Your Kanban board is stellar! Really well done! You're making the rest of the teams look bad with this Kanban board!!!
